This project will investigate the classification abilities of the LASSO regression algorithm by testing on readily available datasets like MNIST and Yale B. Additionally, this algorithm will be paired with other engineering methods, like compressed sensing with QR decomposition with column pivoting, to expand upon its capabilities. One way to potentially advance the level of this project is to use multi-dimensional data, like video data, for classification.

This project will build on the works of prior research which are documented in the following three papers.

  a.) Robust Face Recognition via Sparse Representation - J. Wright, A. Y. Yang, A. Ganesh, S. S. Sastry, Y. Ma.
  b.) Supervised Trace Lasso for Robust Face Recognition - J. Lai, X. Jiang.
  c.) Data Driven Sparse Sensor Placement for Reconstruction - K. Manohar, B. W. Brunton, J. N. Kutz, S. L. Brunton.

Results of the classificational accuracy can be represented using heatmaps or color-coded coefficient plots that show the audience how the LASSO coefficients are used to make accurate predictions.
